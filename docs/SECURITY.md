# Security

How NextUp keeps companies apart, what protects each door, and what has to land before
real customers depend on it. Read this before touching login, `/admin`, stages or the API.

## Demo data vs. real people

Every company has a `stage` (`src/features/admin/stages.ts`). The code is identical for all four;
what changes is what the stage **allows**. `policyFor(stage)` is the one place that decides, and
the server actions check it - hiding a button is only a courtesy.

| | `demo` | `sandbox` · `pilot` · `live` |
|---|---|---|
| Whose data | Ours - made-up people and cases | Theirs - real people, real cases |
| "View the demo as..." list on the login page (`LOGIN_DEMO_FILL`) | yes | **no** - never shown, `demoSignIn` refuses |
| How people log in | their personal code or Microsoft - or, on a demo box, the list above | their **personal code** or **Microsoft** only - the staff list never reaches the browser |
| Dev panel: switch person, +1 day, reset, delete added | yes (managers for the last three) | **no** - panel hidden, actions refuse |
| People sent to the browser | the whole company (the dev panel needs them) | the signed-in viewer only |
| Move back to `demo` | - | **refused** - create a separate demo company instead |

An unknown stage gets the real-people policy: fail closed. Creating a company in `/admin` asks
"Who logs in" - demo or real people (sandbox).

## Doors and their locks

| Door | Lock | Brake (`src/server/throttle.ts`) |
|---|---|---|
| `/[company]/login` | personal login code per person (~59 bits, sha256 stored, `src/features/auth/login-code.ts`) - the code alone says who you are | 10 tries / 10 min per address+company; 200 / 10 min per company |
| `/[company]/login/microsoft` | Entra ID OpenID Connect, code flow + PKCE, state + nonce in a signed 10-min cookie; token's `tid` must equal the company's tenant; person matched by `oid` (bound on first sign-in by email) - `src/features/auth/entra.ts` | Microsoft's own |
| `/admin/login` | `ADMIN_ACCESS_CODE`, constant-time compare | 5 tries / 15 min per address |
| `/contact` | honeypot + server-side validation | 5 / hour per address |
| `/api/[company]/events` | bearer token (sha256 hash stored), scoped to one company | - (token is 192 bits) |
| Every server action | re-checks the session for the slug; never trusts the client for actor or company | - |
| Case and idea events | `mayAppend` (`src/features/cases/permissions.ts`): only whoever holds a case (or a manager) decides, hands or asks; only the raiser answers; only managers re-route or move the clock; no re-raising an existing id | - |
| `n8n.<domain>`, `mail.<domain>` | Caddy `basic_auth` from `OPS_USER` / `OPS_PASSWORD_HASH`; unset = 401 for everyone | - |

Sessions are HMAC-signed cookies (`src/features/auth/cookie.ts`), `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and
`Secure` whenever `COOKIE_SECURE=true` **or** `PUBLIC_SCHEME=https`. Post-login redirects only go
to same-site paths (`safeNextPath`). `next.config.ts` sends a strict CSP, `frame-ancestors 'none'`,
HSTS, `nosniff` and a referrer policy.

## Before the first real customer

1. ~~**Per-person login.**~~ Done: a personal login code per person (issued and replaced in
   `/admin` -> Companies -> People & sign-in) and "Continue with Microsoft" per company. The shared
   company code opens nothing any more (`Company.accessCodeHash` is kept, nullable, until old
   rows are gone). Still open: team leaders issuing codes themselves instead of the admin, and an
   Entra app registration for the production box (`ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` / `ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET`).
2. **Session revocation.** Partly done: `getViewerFor` checks every session against the database
   (same company id, the person still exists with the same role, and `Company.sessionEpoch`
   unchanged - a stage move bumps it, so demo sessions end when real people move in). Still open:
   issuing someone a new code does not end the session they already have. Add
   `User.sessionVersion` next to the epoch and bump it on new code/offboarding.
3. **Admin as people, not a shared code.** One `ADMIN_ACCESS_CODE` for everyone means no audit of
   who did what. Named admin users (magic link or SSO) plus 2FA.
4. **Audit log for admin actions** - create, stage move, issue login code, issue token, delete - as
   events, like everything else.
5. **Shared rate-limit store.** The throttle counts in process memory: right for one Hetzner box,
   per-instance on Vercel. Move the `Map` to a Postgres table when there is more than one process.
6. **Role-scoped data.** The whole case log goes to every signed-in browser; roles only choose
   which pages show it. If members must not see something, filter it on the server.
7. **GDPR basics** - a processing record, a DPA with each customer, data export and deletion per
   company (delete exists; export does not), backup encryption and retention.

## Ongoing

- `npm audit` in CI and Dependabot alerts on. Today's 4 "high" findings sit in Prisma's CLI tooling
  (`mysql2`, `deepmerge-ts`), not in the runtime; `npm audit fix --force` would downgrade Prisma to
  v6 - wait for a Prisma release instead.
- `LOGIN_DEMO_FILL` / `ADMIN_DEMO_FILL` only on demo boxes. `/admin/connections` flags both.
- Anything published by Docker on a laptop binds to `127.0.0.1`, never all interfaces.
- A pentest by an outside firm before `live`.
