# The raise-page assistant

An employee with a problem or an idea types one line on the raise page. Before anything is raised,
NextUp answers from the company's own knowledge: who handles this, what already exists, which goal
it touches. If that solves it, nothing is raised. If it does not, **Raise it anyway** turns the
conversation into a normal raise, with the question as the title and the answer as context, and the
usual 8-step evaluation runs.

The knowledge comes from the tables in `docs/COMPANY_KNOWLEDGE.md` (units, roles, routing, goals,
profile) plus **documents** that n8n pushes from the ERP and other systems.

## Data flow

```
browser ── POST /api/<company>/assist (same origin, session cookie) ──▶ route handler
                                                                        │
  features/assist  ─ 1 redact question + history (names → roles, secrets/PII → [masks])
                   ─ 2 marked above the ceiling? → refuse, nothing sent
                   ─ 3 provider.run(system prompt, tools)   ◀── the only outside call
                        tools: list_routes · get_role · get_goals · get_company_profile ·
                               search_documents  (read-only, company from the session)
                        tool output redacted again before the model sees it
                   ─ 4 checkAnswer: mask again, keep only citations handed out by the tools
                        and under the ceiling, flag "unsourced"
                                                                        │

```

- **Provider** (`src/server/assist/provider.ts`): `bedrock` is Claude on Amazon Bedrock through the
  `AnthropicBedrockMantle` client in `LLM_REGION` (default `eu-central-1`). `mock` has no model. It
  strings the tool results into an answer, and it is what demo, e2e and local dev use. The mock is
  chosen whenever `LLM_PROVIDER`/`LLM_MODEL` are unset.
- **Gate** (`features/assist/gate.ts`), which fails closed:

  | Situation | What answers |
  |---|---|
  | demo stage | configured provider |
  | real stage, assistant switched off | nobody (the page raises directly, as before) |
  | real stage, on, no DPA date | mock only, no model call |
  | real stage, on, DPA date recorded | configured provider |
  | no database (no audit trail) | mock only |

- **Streaming** shows only finished sentences, each already through `checkAnswer`, so a
  half-streamed name or number is never on screen.

## TISAX / compliance controls

These controls **support** a customer's security and privacy review; they do not make the feature
TISAX-compliant by themselves, and using Bedrock is not proof of any retention setting. Before real
employee traffic, the customer's compliance owner signs off purpose, data categories, access,
retention, sub-processors and incident handling (see *Before a pilot*).

| Control | Where |
|---|---|
| Information classification (public · internal · confidential · strictly confidential) | `features/assist/classify.ts`. Every document carries one; a document without a label is stored as confidential |
| Ceiling on what the assistant may read (default internal; strictly confidential never) | `CompanyConfig.classificationCeiling`, enforced in SQL (`searchDocuments`) **and** again in the tool |
| Questions marked "streng vertraulich" / "confidential" above the ceiling are not sent | `redact.ts markerOf` + `assist()` |
| Data minimisation: known names, personal data and secrets are masked before the model | `redact.ts`: names become roles; email, phone, IBAN, card, VIN, keys and passwords are masked; company patterns come from `redactPatterns`. **Risk reduction, not a guarantee**: pattern matching misses free-text context ("the colleague who was off sick in May"). If a customer needs a guarantee, the assistant stays off for them |
| EU processing | Bedrock called in `eu-central-1`. With an EU geographic inference profile the request can be served by other EU regions; Frankfurt-only needs a single-region model. The browser never talks to a third party (CSP `connect-src 'self'` unchanged) |
| Company rules | `CompanyProfile.complianceRules`, put into the system prompt after the fixed guardrails |
| No decisions about people | Guardrails in `prompt.ts`. The assistant points to roles; it proposes, never decides |
| Audit trail | `AssistTurn`: redacted text, cited sources, masked-item counts, model, prompt version, tokens, latency |
| Retention | `CompanyConfig.retentionDays` (default 90). The assist route purges hourly per company |
| Kill switch | `/admin/knowledge` → Assistant → Off |
| Works council (BetrVG §87) | Admin sees counts only (answers, solved, raised anyway, unsourced, blocked). There is no per-person view |
| Abuse / cost | Throttles `assistAsk` (20 per 10 min per person) and `assistAskAll` (600 per 10 min per company) |

For the customer's records: the processing record names AWS (Bedrock, EU regions per the chosen routing) as sub-processor
for redacted question text and knowledge snippets. The DPA date in `/admin` is the switch that
allows model calls for real people.

## Operating it

- **Turn on** in `/admin/knowledge` → Assistant: On, ceiling, DPA date, rules, extra patterns.
- **Model**: set `LLM_PROVIDER=bedrock`, `LLM_MODEL` (default `anthropic.claude-opus-5`),
  `LLM_REGION`, and AWS credentials in the stack's `.env`. Enable the model in the AWS account's
  Bedrock console for that region first.
- **Documents**: `ops/n8n/erp-knowledge-sync.json`, described in `ops/n8n/README.md`. Tokens made in `/admin` carry
  `knowledge:write`.
- **Prompt changes**: bump `ASSIST_PROMPT_VERSION`. It is stored on every turn.

## Before a pilot

In order: mock provider → a sandbox company on a controlled Bedrock test → a customer pilot.

- [ ] Bedrock account: model enabled, **exact model / inference-profile ID** in `LLM_MODEL`, EU
      geographic vs single-region routing agreed with the customer.
- [ ] Bedrock data retention and logging settings of that AWS account checked and written down.
- [ ] Customer compliance owner has approved the processing (purpose, data categories, access,
      retention, sub-processor AWS, incidents); DPA date recorded in `/admin`.
- [ ] Audit rows reviewed on the sandbox: redacted text only, blocked turns recorded without the original.

## Not done yet

- Embeddings (pgvector). Search is Postgres full-text (`simple` config). `searchDocuments` is the one place to
  change.
- Editing a single document in `/admin`. Removing one works (`/admin/knowledge` → Documents →
  Remove); n8n re-adds it on its next run if the source still has it.
- n8n follow-up actions (e.g. open an ERP ticket) after the employee confirms. The model never
  triggers n8n itself.
- Refusal fallback to a second model. A refusal today ends the answer with "raise it".
