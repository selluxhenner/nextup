// What /admin shows when there is no database answering.
//
// The rest of the app already falls back to the built-in acme tenant (features/demo, orDemo), so
// /admin used to be the one surface that went blank - a demo visitor clicked it and got a stack
// trace in prose. These rows fill it with the same demo company the dashboard runs on, so the
// screen is complete and the page says plainly, once, that this is not the real database.
//
// Nothing here is writable: creating, rotating and deleting all need Postgres. The page hides
// those controls in demo mode rather than offering buttons that answer with an error.
